      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name is Ryan Shaffer. I worked in the horticulture industry for seven years before deciding on pursuing life in a new way.
        My missions is simple, build as much as I can as fast as I can. I am pursuing this construction via practical means. I would love to 
        leave my mark along the way as well. That means to enrich the lives of those I come into contact with, and maybe even those I never meet.

        <p>This project was a doozy for me. It was my first instance of <span>refcatoring</span>! It took me at least fifteen hours to comb through the code to ensure I had ironed out all the kinks and removed unneccesary code.
        Along the way I learned lots about CSS. </p>
