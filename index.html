      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name is Ryan Shaffer. I got into coding for the sake of learning something new and I hear it can be quite the challenge to ascertain. I like a good challenge, so bring it on! Furthermore, I aspire to make a career for myself in the tech industry.

        <p>This first project stemmed from the 'pre-work' phase of the coding bootcamp I attended through the University of Minnesota. This project was an all encompassing assignment. From partaking, I gained exposure to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. Loads of merging conflicts occurred... and then were overcome!

        <p>This project was a doozy for me. It was my first instance of <span class="refactoring-span">refcatoring</span>! It took me at least fifteen hours to comb through the code to ensure I had ironed out all the kinks and removed unneccesary lines.
          Along the way, I learned lots about CSS. Grouping items to be stylized and having a plan for code layout were the main takeawys. </p>
